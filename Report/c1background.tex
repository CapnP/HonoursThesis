\section{First-Order Logic Terms and Notation}
\label{sec:senfol}

This thesis focuses around the extension of \beagle, a \emph{first-order logic} (FOL) theorem prover.
In order to understand beagle's purpose and functions a basic understanding of the FOL logical system
is required. This section provides a rudimentary overview of FOL syntax and uses;
but also includes an explanation of any specialised terms and notation used throughout the paper.

\section{Automated Reasoning and Theorem Proving}
\label{sec:proving}

Automated Reasoning is a rapidly growing field of research where computer programs
are used to solve problems stated in first order logic statments or other formal logics.

\label{sec:fingerprint}

\emph{Fingerprint Indexing} is a recent technique developed by \citeN{shulz12}.

\section{The Beagle Theorem Prover}
\label{sec:beagle}

The core implementation of Beagle was developed by Peter Baumgartner et al. of NICTA.
Its purpose was to demonstrate the capabilities of the \emph{Weak Abstraction with Heirachic Superposition Calculus};
which allows the incorporation of prior knowledge via a `background reasoning' modules.

\section{Scala}
\label{sec:scala}

As mentioned above \beagle is written in \emph{Scala}, the Scalable Language. Scala
is a functional language and may be confusing to those who are not familiar with the
functional programming paradigm. This thesis will contain occasional snippets of
Scala code; but note that any snippets used will be accompanied by an explanation
and in general an understanding of Scala is not required.





We add a few blank pages here to illustrate section
headings\index{Section~headings} on odd
pages (other than the first page in a new chapter).

Also, here is an example of a citation, and another
.  If in the context,
it makes sense to talk about the work of an author in a more
integrated way, like, that can be done
too\index{Books~to~read|textbf}.  Because the information on this page
is \emph{so} important, it has been indexed too (see the index at the
back of this thesis).\footnote{However, it is \emph{strongly}
  advisable to leave indexing until the thesis is complete.  Donald
  Knuth says to allow about a day for the task of indexing.  In my
  experience he was spot-on.}
