\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}

This thesis provides a detailed account of how an optimisation technique known
as Term Indexing was added to the \beagle\ first order logic theorem prover. \Beagle\ 
is a \emph{resolution} prover which 

\section{Goals and Motivation}
\label{sec:mot}

\subsection{Current Performance of Beagle}

The primary goal of this project is the implementation of Term Indexing
for the \beagle\ theorem prover. 
\Beagle\ was created essentially as a demonstration or proof of concept for the \emph{\HSWAC} \cite{baum13}.
This logical calculus allows the inclusion of \emph{background reasoning modules}
which allow the instant 

\subsection{Measuring Performance}

After providing an implementation of Fingerprint Indexing we will wish to measure
how it has affected \beagle's performance.

\subsection{Cross Validating Fingerprint Indexing}

Fingerprint indexing itself is a very new technique; introduced for the first
time in \cite{shulz12}. At the time of writing this paper presented the only
implementation of Fingerprint Indexing. By implementing the technique in \beagle\ 
we will be providing the Term Indexing field with more evidence regarding the
overall performance of Fingerprint Indexing.

\subsection{Improving Fingerprint Indexing}

Another side-goal of the project is to investigate and implement original
improvements to Fingerprint Indexing.

\subsection{Background}

The background chapter (Chapter \ref{cha:background}) provides necessary background material required to understand
the concepts used in implementing Fingerprint Indexing.

This includes a literature review where we discuss 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reference glossary of important logic terms.
\item Definition of Term Indexing
\item
\end{itemize}

It will also provide
an in depth explanation of how Fingeprint Indexing works including its advantages
over other Term Indexing techniques.

\subsection{Method}

The method chapter (Chapter \ref{cha:method}) will cover in detail the
