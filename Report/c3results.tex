\section{Indexing Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

\subsection{Problem Selection}
Not going to run everything against all of TPTP. Will take out a subset
of TPTP (25--50 problems) run them against this set.
Show the set and justify inclusions/exclusions

\subsection{Speed}

\subsection{False Positives}
Explain this metric and how it impacts performance

\section{Indexing Subsumption}
\label{sec:indexresults}

\subsection{Metric Results}

We observe many, even after a myriad of optimisations. Notice
that this is due to the structure of beagle; many retrieved terms
are cheaply thrown out due to other conditions (such as being a parent
term, being ordered, etc.) and do not significantly impact performance.

Refer to email from Stephan. compare false positive results
