\section{Why this is a Very Clever Thesis}
\label{sec:why}

\section{Future Improvements}
\label{sec:future}

Here we list some thoughts on possible improvements to \beagle\ and Fingerprint
indexing in general; which were either not relevant to the current work or
cut due to time constraints.

\subsection{Extended Data Structures}
The focus of this thesis has been with high-level logical improvements.
Add some low-level speed at the cost of memory.

Drop the tree structure. Have an entry for each possible fingerprint and add terms
to each bin they are compatible with during indexing. Moves runtime from
retrieval (called VERY often) to indexing (called barley ever) but creates memory
EXPLOSION
