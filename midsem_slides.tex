\subsection{The Beagle Theorem Prover}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{The Beagle Theorem Prover}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Beagle is a First-Order-Logic resolution theorem prover with equality.
  \item<2-> Makes use of modular 'Background Theories' to make efficient use of known facts.
  \item<3-> This requires the carefully constructed `Hierarchic Superposition with Weak Abstraction
  Calculus' in order to ensure consistency and completeness.
  \item<4-> Has been extended with term indexing to efficiently locate clauses which
  match the calculus resolution rules.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Term Indexing} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Term Indexing Techniques}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Term indexers aim to collect all FOL terms which potentially match a `query' term.
  \item<1-> Three important relations:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> 'Unifiable': $\sigma s = \sigma t$
  \item<2-> 'Instance Of': $s = \sigma t$
  \item<2-> 'Generalises': $\sigma s = t$
  \end{itemize}
  \item<3-> Top-Symbol Hashing.
  \item<3-> Discriminant Trees.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Maintain a collection of \emph{fingerprints} for terms.
  \item<2-> A term fingerprint is an array over $F \cup \{\mathbf{A, B, N}\}$.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> Beagle has been extended with a baseline implementation of Fingerprint
  Indexing.
  \item<2-> Required significant modification to current implementation
  (code refactoring and additional pointer structures).
  \item<3-> Operates on Beagle's most costly inference rule, superposition:\\

\subsection{Tailoring to Beagle}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Fingerprint Indexing for the Hierarchic Superposition with Weak Abstraction Calculus}
                  %Left Bot Right Top
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> As mentioned, current implementation is somewhat `na\"{i}ve'.
  \item<2-> Fingerprint indexing could be greatly improved by tailoring it specifically
  to Beagle's FOL calculus.
  \item<2-> Main improvement is to consider Beagle's \emph{foreground} and \emph{background}
  terms.
  \item<3-> Furthermore indexing may be applied to more
  of HSWA's inference rules; in particular simplification.
  \item<4-> These extensions will not require so much modification; as the fingerprint
  indexing framework is already built.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Other Improvements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Other Potential Indexing Improvements}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1-> An additional goal of the project is to consider how Fingerprint Indexing
  could be improved upon more generally.
  \item<2-> The main area to consider here is the sampling positions. Sampling many
  positions reduces the returned sets, but increases indexing overhead.
  \item<3-> Large problems better suit indexing; but it is difficult to know ahead of
  time what a `large' problem is.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Beagle Comparisons}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
  \frametitle{Comparing Beagle With Other FOL Provers}
  \item<1-> Once Beagle's indexing has been implemented and extended with extra features
  it will be interesting to compare it's results against existing provers.
